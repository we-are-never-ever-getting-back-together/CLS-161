I was a bit struggled to go through the logic of this paper because of some details in the middle, but as I looked up the author, and understood more about the context of this paper, and its motivation. A fun fact I discovered is that Vannevar Bush was born in Everrett, Massachusetts.

"As we may think" addresses how the development of technology promotes the development of sciences. He made a strong case for the cause of scientific research, but more persistently, the dissemination of research. He started the paper by making a case of how scientific specialization immensely improved the the knowledge of the field collectively, but the bridge between disciplines are superficial, leading to the barriers to laypersons and whoever interested in the research.

He proceed to predict that the future of scientific advancement will be facillitated by the development of new forms of information recording, retrieval, and sharing. It is also worth noting an equally, if not more, prominent figure also fathered the idea of personal computer: Alan Turing, with his paper in 1936 on Universal Machine. However, while Turing machine, or more like its specification, focuses on the essentials of a "digital" computer, Bush's Memex serves as a huge source of inspiration for the use to which computer was put by the pioneers of personal-computer revolution, many of which incorporated in today's system. Regardless, both Turing and Bush impressively managed to articulate almost 100 years ago the conception of a cognitive agent, and how human intelligence relates to machines' "intelligence", whose comparisons in turns will shed lights on the nature of human mind
