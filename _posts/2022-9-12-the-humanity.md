This week's reading is an introductory chapter to The Humanities. In this chapter, the author introduced the definition of humanities, its difference from the social sciences, and its importance of the humanities.

According to the author, the term "humanities" suggests something "universal" and "applicable" in multiple cultural and historial context, instead of being confined by space or time. A tentative definition was offered, in which humanities are considered to be disciplines in which humans seek understanding of human self-understanding and self-expressions, and of the way people constructs and experience the world they live in.

This definition answers a question of why we study humanities, in world where contribution to society of a field is measured by its materialistic values. It is important to study humanities because it helps us to understand ourselves better. Analysis of documents and artifacts requires critical thinking skills, and the ability to remain objective to different perspectives. To be able to have a comprehensive understanding of various cultures, objectivity is of the utmost importance, and that ability keeps being underestimated in fields that are more quantitative or proof-based. The role of a humanities scholar is never to judge but to conduct methodologically agnostic analysis.
